Hello and welcome to my personal blog!

This is a place where I will eventually share my thoughts on web development, programming languages and any other `nerd stuff` I like. Feel home.

## A little about me

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about web development, open source, movies and video games. I've many years of exeperience working with Python, Ruby and JavaScript (Java too, but let's pretend it never happend). Currently I'm freelancing and looking for joining a great team in Canada or Europe (Norway, Switzerland, Berlin or Spain).

I'm also learning guitar.
